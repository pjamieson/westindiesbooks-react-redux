This candid autobiography illustrates how Paras' whole life has been geared to being 'proper', from early days learning the Queen's English to life as the most upright of politicians. Pity that Paras never noticed the laughter and ridicule permeating all the tapes he has of his doings.... Full of wit and wisdom, The Autobiography of Paras P. is a tongue-in-cheek glimpse into the life of one man who honestly believes he is the last bastion of morality in Trinidad & Tobago. <i>(Heinemann synopsis)</i>"

Despite his obvious abilities, he cannot complete his education, and is forced instead to take up ignominious work for Glenn, a white homosexual trader. Trapped by a system of prejudices, and deeply humiliated, Apata is pushed into a cycle of crime that leads to the life of a fugitive, and a grisly demise.",

The Protagonist, Bighead, confronts the hypocrisies of expected behaviors in an environment not quite ready for change. He deals with his challenges using a success formula based on trial and error as well as being influenced by strong role models of both sexes. Bighead is a universal character, and the lessons he learns are the lessons for us all. <em>(L.Snow, May 1997)</em>"

				"Kamau Brathwaite was born in Barbados in 1930. He graduated from England's Cambridge University with a B.A. in history in his early 20s, and received his Ph.D. from the University of Sussex in 1968. He lived and worked in Ghana from 1955 to 1962. From the 'rooflessness' of his sojourn in Europe, Brathwaite found a rootedness in Africa that would sharpen his sense of 'wholeness' and shape his awareness, making him what the Ghanaian poet Kofi Awoonor once called 'a poet of the total African consciousness.' The Arrivants: A New World Trilogy (1973) and the second trilogy, Mother Poem (1977), Sun Poem (1982) and X/Self (1987) are among Brathwaite's published works that surged his international standing.",
				"Brathwaite, the distinguished Caribbean poet, historian and literary critic, lives in Barbados at Cow Pastor, part of an estate that includes the sacred burial ground of his ancestors that were enslaved. He has taught at the University of the West Indies and lectured at New York University. Awards and honors for his poetry and non-fiction include the Guggenheim Fellowship, Fulbright Fellowship, Bussa Award, Casa de las Americas Prize for Literary Criticism, and the Neustadt International Prize for Literature."

Like many children of emigrants, Danticat felt great pressure to become 'a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer.' Only because she had a scholarship did she attend Brown University to earn an MFA in creative writing instead of attending nursing school."

She was educated at St Hilda’s School and was Jamaica Scholar in 1942. She studied at McGill University (Montreal), Slade School of Fine Art (London) and at the University of West Indies School of Education. She started out work as a journalist on the Public Opinion newspaper, taught art in Kingston and then taught English for many years at Brown’s Town Community College until her retirement in 1985. She is one of Jamaica’s most outstanding painters, her work first coming to notice in the 1940s. Her paintings of rural Jamaican life are particularly well known, with strong sympathies for grass-roots people, though there is nothing sentimental in her work, which has strong surreal, non-figurative elements. She is also an important art critic, with scores of articles in Jamaica Journal over the years. She was awarded the Order of Distinction in 1977 and the Silver Musgrave medal in 1989 for her services in the field of art. She died in 2002."],

Brenda Flanagan recalls having a hunger for involvement with the wider world and dreamt of being a writer. She started writing poetry at the age of ten and by thirteen she was singing calypsos and earning money for it. However, at the age of fourteen she had to leave school to help support her family, by then only parented by her mother. She worked for a time in a factory, then was taken on as a trainee reporter of The Nation, the newspaper of the then ruling People's National Movement led by Dr. Eric Williams. In 1967 she left Trinidad for the USA, working initially as a domestic servant. Marriage and motherhood deflected her plans to study, but by 1975, then a single mother, she began undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan. There she won prestigious Hopwood Awards for her short stories, a novel and drama ('When the Jumbie Bird Calls')."],

She grew up in a large, extended family, largely under the influence of her maternal grandmother. Her grandmother took the view that the child would learn more by being taken all over the county with her, and being given space for wonder and enquiry, than in the regimented system of primary schooling. As a result Beryl Gilroy did not enter full time schooling until she was twelve. It is clear that much of her grandmother’s influence persisted in Beryl Gilroy’s own philosophy of education (she educated her own children at home) that stressed freedom for discovery within a framework of basic skills. Between 1951-53 she attended the University of London pursuing a Diploma in Child Development. Although a qualified teacher, racism prevented her getting a post for some time, and she had to work as a washer-up at Lyons, a factory clerk and lady’s maid. Between 1970-75 she wrote the pioneering children’s series 'Nippers' which contain probably the first reflection of the Black British presence in UK writing for children. In addition to her fiction and autobiographical books, she was a pioneering teacher and psychotherapist who was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of London and an Honorary Fellowship by the Institute of Education for her writing and pioneering work as a psychotherapist. She died in 2001 at the age of 76."],

Her poems encompass the lives of women old and young; middle-class and sufferers; women whose lives are enclosed, who want liberation from the 'station of motherhood, wifehood and frustration', and women who through their resistance, creativity and assertion of selfhood have made space for themselves. The celebration of such lives stands as a beacon of hope in the depiction of Jamaican society in which rape, poverty and abandonment are too frequently women's lot."],

In 1976 he was awarded the Medal of Merit, Class One, Gold, by the Trinidadian Government for his meritorious service in education and culture. His proudest achievement was to have made a key contribution to getting West Indian literature accepted in schools. His lecturing activities in this period undoubtedly held back his own writing, though he had poems published in Bim, Kyk-over-Al, Trinidad and Tobago Review, Savacou, The Greenfield Review and Caribbean Quarterly.

				"<strong>Charles Borromeo Hodge</strong> was born on November 9, 1939, to St.Martin parents in San Nicholas, Aruba. He was raised by his grandmother, Ann Catherine Hodge, in St.Martin, where he attended St. Joseph School. He completed elementary and high school in Curacao, where he won the Neerlandia Prijs for composition writing.",
				"In 1959, Hodge, with high school diploma in hand, headed home, again. That same year, the grass roots political activist Leonides 'Bahba' Richardson, introduced Hodge to the nation's father of journalism and political progressive Joseph H. Lake. Sr. Lake's influence on Hodge's writing and political development would be profound and not without controversy. Hodge's first poem, 'The Rock,' appeared in a 1959 issue of Lake's Winward Islands Opinion. He also wrote articles 'of a radical nature,' at a time when many St.Martiners hid in the alleys of Great Bay (Philipsburg) to buy the Opinion newspaper, because of its writings against 'slave wages' and the political system that were 'keeping down people.'",
				"In 1970, Hodge emigrated to Harlem, USA. In that 'Black Mecca' of New York City, the St. Martiner wrote most of the poems of his first volume, <em>Songs & Images for St.Martin</em> (1997). In 1991, Hodge returned to St.Martin, 'to stay.' After his return home, his poems, short stories, essays, and commentaries appeared with ravenous persistency in especially the daily St.Maarten Guardian. The senior poet's writings also appeared regularly in the nation's other publications until his death in 1998."

			"bio": ["Towering, breathtakingly limber interpretive dancer Geoffrey Holder was born in Trinidad and educated at Queens Royal College. Holder's first professional dancing gig was in his brother Roscoe's travelling troupe. He toured the West Indies and Puerto Rico before making his New York stage debut in the 1954 Broadway musical House of Flowers. Heading his own troupe from 1956 onward, Holder appeared as both an ensemble dancer and as soloist and choreographer in 'outside' productions. He made his dramatic bow in 1957 in the near-mime role of Lucky in 'Waiting for Godot.' His subsequent stage work has earned him numerous awards, including two Tonys--one for direction, the other for costume design--for 1974's 'The Wiz.' His film roles leaned towards the exotic, e.g. Baron Samedi in the 1973 James Bond thriller 'Live and Let Die' (1973) and Punjab in 'Annie' (1981). He is best known to TV fans for his series of mid-1970 Seven Up commercials, in which he elegantly and laughingly extoled the virtues of 'Un-Cola Nuts.' Outside of his theatrical and film accomplishments, Holder is an accomplished painter, his works having been showcased in several major international exhibitions. He is also the author of several books. Geoffrey Holder is married to dancer Carmen de Lavallade. [Biography from 'The Caribbean Hall of Fame']"],

Their vanguard is earning critical attention throughout the Caribbean and beyond from noted artists and institutions.

Her recitals have been at functions ranging from a 'book party' for scholar George Lamming to a protest against the proposed 'Franco-Dutch' colonial treaty. Before graduating from Marist College (BA, 1993), she had been published in MC's Collection of Non-fiction Student Writings, listed in Who's Who of Students in American Colleges and Universities, and picked up the National Collegiate Communications Award.

Since 1986, House of Nehesi has published more books in and about St.Martin, and by St.Martin writers, than any similar period in the island's post-Colombian history. Sekou has helped to demystify the writing and publishing of books by St.Martiners in St.Martin. He continues personally and through House of Nehesi to encourage critical research, reading, and writing, particularly with regard to St.Martin/Caribbean oral and recorded history, culture, and the natural environment. Sekou has secured the publication of literary/scholarly books by writers from Saba, Curacao, Barbados, Tortola, and the USA. Sekou has recited at the prestigious University of The West Indies Caribbean Writers Series, and for other universities, international festivals, and organizations throughout the Caribbean, USA, England, Germany, The Netherlands, and Korea. Scholars/writers Kamau Brathwaite (UWI/New York University), Dr. Howard Fergus (Montserrat), Dr. Joseph Pereira (UWI/Jamaica), Wim Rutgers (Aruba), Daniella Jeffry (St.Martin), Fabian Badejo (St.Martin) are among those who consider Sekou to be one of the most prolific new generation Caribbean poets. According to Dr. Fergus, Sekou's writings and his work at House of Nehesi are serving not only to bring St.Martin's culture to the region and the world but also to let the world know that there are serious literary activities going on in the eastern Caribbean. Sekou's poetry and reviews of his writings have appeared in Callaloo, Discover St. Martin-St.Maarten, The Caribbean Writer, Del Caribe (Cuba), The Massachusetts Review (USA), De Gids (The Netherlands), Revue Noir (France), and other national, regional and international journals and magazines. Sekou's articles on history, culture, and politics appear regularly in St.Martin's Newsday (which he edited 1984-1997). In 1994, Lasana M.

					"summary": ["Nigel Thomas writes with compelling honesty about the confusing maze of pressures that paralyze Jerome Quashee, who undergoes a religious ritual, blocking all sensual links to the outside world in order to see clearly into his past and find the sources of the pain and guilt that torment his soul. His intelligence at first promises him a gateway out of the poverty his parents have known, but he must compete with privileged white boys for scholarships in a racist, class-ridden culture. He wrestles with both the guilt of knowing so little about his African heritage and the simultaneous pressure to think, speak, and act as a white person. And he will bring disgrace on his family if he does not suppress his emerging homosexuality. <i>(Publisher's synopsis)</i>"],

Written over three weeks, it records her short life; her lonely childhood in France, her marriage to an African student, and her eager return, with him, to Africa -- the land of her ancestors. In stark contrast to her naive illusions, the social realities of traditional Muslim life and their cultural demands on her as a woman threaten to drive her to unendurable extremes of loneliness and complete alienation. She is a foreigner, in spite of the color of her skin. <i>(Heinemann synopsis)</i>"],

She graduated from the University College of the West Indies, Jamaica, with a B.A. in history, Latin and English in 1957, followed with a Diploma in Education in 1958. Wilson worked as a high school English teacher in Jamaica and Morocco, before returning home in 1969, and serving in Barbados' Ministry of Foreign Affairs and at the Caribbean Tourism Research Centre. She was instrumental in establishing the National Independence Festival of creative Arts (NIFCA) in 1973, and for nearly thirty years has been representing her country and the cultural arts on national, regional and international boards, committees and fora in dance, theater and tourism. The president of Stage One Theatre Productions (1980-1982), manager of the Barbados Dance Theatre Company (1985-1988) and administrative director of WWB Productions (1986-1996), Wilson has also served as chairperson of the Association of Caribbean Theatre Artists (ACTA) and a director of the CARICOM Foundation for Arts and Culture. She is a member of numerous other cultural foundations, including the Barbados museum and historical society. Fluent in French and Spanish, she is well-known in Barbados and other parts of the Caribbean as an actor, storyteller, producer and dancer. As one of Barbados' grandes dames of the cultural arts, Wilson has produced 'Paint it Jazz' for the Barbados Jazz Festival (1994-1995), as well as the official presentations for royal visits and visiting dignitaries and heads of state (1975-1990), and numerous dance, musical and theater productions. In 1998, this wife and mother of three founded her nation's Stroke Support Group. The writing of poetry and stories has been a consistent but mostly private part of Wilson's life and professional career and 'Same Sea ... Another Wave' is her first book and the fruit of a long-standing dream. Awards and honors include the Barbados Service Star, the Bussa Award, University of the West Indies at Cave Hill Humanities Scholar, University of the West Indies at Mona Distinguished Graduate Award, and the Earl Warner Trust Lifetime Achievement Award."],
